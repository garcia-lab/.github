# Contributing to the Garcia Lab

First of all, welcome! 👋🎉 We are proud to have this opportunity to work together with you to build and share knowledge around the lab and various topics on technology, and to help you find what you need.

## Getting started

This Garcia Lab organization uses repositories for documentation and knowledge, both technical and high level. We welcome any and all issues and pull requests to collaborate and contribute. For any questions, create an issue or a pull request in the associated repository, or reach out to an organization owner.

And again, thank you! We are excited to work together with you. ❤️

## Ready to propose a change?
